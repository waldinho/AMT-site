It’s only been a month, say some, give him a chance.</p> <p>Others suggest that with his flurry of executive orders, and his undoubted willingness to overturn the apple cart, Mr Trump has done more in a month than Barack Obama achieved in eight years. </p> <p>“I’m very pleased with what he is doing. I think he’s a true American. He has shown he can make money, I hope he can make peace,” said Joyce Boyner, 75, who was taking an evening walk.</p> <p>“And I am very angry at the media. They are so rude, they are so ignorant. They way they argue with him, and think they know better than him.”</p> <p>Grant County sits in the Sandhills of western Nebraska, 350 miles from Omaha. The 2010 census put the population at 614, spread out over 783 square miles. Ranching, and the railways, are the most important industries. </p> <p>A cup of coffee costs 50 cents. People who wear Carhartt-branded clothes invariably do manual work.</p> <p>The county seat, Hyannis, which was established in 1888, sits alongside the rail tracks and the freight trains of the BNSF Railway, its engines sounding like the Memphis Horns as they scream through town.</p> <div class=\"dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-image\"><div class=\"dnd-atom-rendered\"><!-- scald=5250651:sdl_editor_representation --><div class='image'><img src=\"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2017/02/19/11/nicolewhite.jpg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"nicolewhite.jpg\" title=\"nicolewhite.jpg\" /></div><!-- END scald=5250651 --></div><div class=\"dnd-caption-wrapper\">26-year-old Nicole White scored Mr Trump’s first month 8.5 out of 10 (Andrew Buncombe )</div></div> <p>Nicole White, 26, who has four children and whose husband works for the railway, said she thought the President was doing “pretty good”. She said she supported his tightening of immigration laws, as she believed it would make the country safer. </p> <p>Asked about the series of scandals that have dominated political and journalistic circles since Mr Trump took office, she said she believed it had been created by his opponents.</p> <p>“I think it’s more noise than anything else,” she said. “And that women’s march after his inauguration, that was bogus. I think I already have the same rights as any man, and the way some of those people were dressed – some of them were half naked – did not make me respect them.”</p> <p>Asked to score Mr Trump’s performance, she said she would give him an impressive 8.5 as there was “room for improvement in everything”.</p> <p>Indeed, there were very few people in the town willing to give Mr Trump anything lower than an eight. Similarly, there were few who believed the issues that have dominated the US and international media in the 30 days or so Mr Trump has occupied the Oval Office were genuine problems.</p> <p>In contrast, many said they thought much of it was “fake news”, created by Mr Trump’s critics, and the political establishment in Washington that he has vowed to take on.</p> <div class=\"dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-image\"><div class=\"dnd-atom-rendered\"><!-- scald=5250641:sdl_editor_representation --><div class='image'><img src=\"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2017/02/19/11/grantcounty6.jpg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"grantcounty6.jpg\" title=\"grantcounty6.jpg\" /></div><!-- END scald=5250641 --></div><div class=\"dnd-caption-wrapper\">Only 20 people in Grant County voted for Ms Clinton (Andrew Buncombe )</div></div> <p>Troy Lyon, a truck driver who once worked with young offenders, said he believed the political elites in Congress – people from both parties – had for too long run things their way. </p> <p>“Damn right he is shaking it up. He’s not Democrat, he’s not Republican,” he said. “That is why people voted for him.”</p> <p>Mr Lyon said he believed the intelligence agencies and others were trying to “sabotage” Mr Trump. He said he believed Michael Flynn had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his conversation with a Russian envoy.</p> <p>“But how this came out was like a coup,” he said. “It was the intelligence agencies leaking it.”</p> <p>Nebraska, overwhelming white and rural, located close to the geographic centre of the contiguous 48 states, went 58-33 in Mr Trump’s favour last November, and he collected its five electoral votes. In many places, the scale of his victory was more impressive; the <em>Omaha World-Herald</em> said that Mr Trump secured 85 per cent of the vote in 19 of the state’s 93 counties. </p> <p>In truth, Democrats have never fared well here. When Obama won one electoral vote in Nebraska in 2008 – the state splits its five votes – he was the first Democrat to do so since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. Meanwhile, in Grant County, voters have not elected a Democratic presidential candidate since 1936, when Franklin D Roosevelt took his second of four presidential victories.</p> <div class=\"dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-video\"><div class=\"dnd-atom-rendered\"><!-- scald=5250351:sdl_editor_representation --><div class='image'><!-- Start of Brightcove Player --> <div class=\"bc_container\"> <video id=\"5329003084001\" data-account=\"624246174001\" data-player=\"2d3d4a83-ba40-464e-9bfb-2804b076bf67\" data-embed=\"default\" data-video-id=\"5329003084001\" class=\"video-js\" controls></video> <script src=\"http://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/2d3d4a83-ba40-464e-9bfb-2804b076bf67_default/index.min.js\"></script> </div> <!-- End of Brightcove Player --> </div><!-- END scald=5250351 --></div><div class=\"dnd-caption-wrapper\">Donald Trump: Sweden baffled by reference to unknown terror incident</div></div> <p>Reports suggest that just 40 out of the 600 or so residents are registered as Democrats. Tellingly, Grant County is one of ten counties in Nebraska where the Democrats do not have a county chair.</p> <p>Ginger Fosse, who is retired and works part-time as curator of the Grant County Museum, did not vote for Mr Trump. “I didn’t like this attitude, and I didn’t like the things he said,” said Ms Fosse, who said she had worked outside the state and then returned. She added that she tended to keep her views on Mr Trump to herself.</p> <p>Life on the ranches was tough, a constant struggle, she said, as she led <em>The Independent</em> through a collection of old photographs, newspaper clippings, and outfits from 100 years ago. Fewer people these days wanted to take it up. </p> <p>She said she believed the same things that made people in Grant County independent had led them to vote for Mr Trump. “They are very independent people and they don’t like the government in their business,” she said. “And he said he’d put an end to that.”</p> <p>Mr Trump never visited Hyannis. But Theodore Roosevelt did, and his campaign appearance here in 1900 is among Ms Fosse’s photographs. A number of people, former House Speaker John Boehner among them, have said that Mr Trump’s outspokenness and willingness to upset people reminds them of Mr Roosevelt.</p> <div class=\"dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-image\"><div class=\"dnd-atom-rendered\"><!-- scald=5250656:sdl_editor_representation --><div class='image'><img src=\"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2017/02/19/11/grantcounty8.jpg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"grantcounty8.jpg\" title=\"grantcounty8.jpg\" /></div><!-- END scald=5250656 --></div><div class=\"dnd-caption-wrapper\">Nebraska voted 58-33 in favour of Mr Trump (Andrew Buncombe )</div></div> <p>Ms Fosse also had a series of images of the late Chuck Hayward, a cowboy who was born in the city of Alliance, 60 miles away, and who became famous as a Hollywood stuntman, working with the likes of John Wayne, Marlon Brando, Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen. Mr Hayward died in 1998, ruling out the chance of asking his opinion of Mr Trump, a President who does all his own stunts. </p> <p>In Grant County, the median age is 40, and many of those who said they voted for Mr Trump were of retirement age. Gordon Juzenas, 69, whose family originally came from Lithuania and who works for the postal service, said he was attracted by what he said was Mr Trump’s promise of quick action.</p> <p>“I think he is doing ok. Better than the last one,” said Mr Juzenas. “It’s only been 30 days and he’s done more than Obama. He is trying to do something, bringing jobs back to the US.”</p> <p>Dutch and Gisela Grathwahl, who are retired, said they were particularly supportive of Mr Trump’s stance on immigration. While his Muslim travel ban, blocking entry to the US for people from seven Muslim-majority countries, has sparked outcry in many parts of the US, the couple said they supported it.</p> <p>“You can’t just let anyone in,” said Mr Grathwahl. When it was pointed out their families had emigrated to the US from Germany, Ms Grathwahl, said: “That was legal. There was vetting.” She said they had previously lived in Florida, where too many people spoke Spanish rather than English. “You should have to learn English,” she said.</p> <div class=\"relatedlinkslist inline-block-related-list inline-block-left\"> <p class=\"box-title\">Read more</p> <div class=\"relatedlinkslist-content\" style=\"min-height: 10px;\"> <ul class=\"related\"><li><a data-author=\"Ben Kentish...\" data-nid=\"7588496\" data-publish_date=\"19-02-2017\" href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/new-york-times-editorial-donald-trump-inept-apprentice-us-media-florida-rally-a7588496.html\">New York Times hits back at 'desperate, inept apprentice' Trump</a></li> <li><a data-author=\"Chloe Farand...\" data-nid=\"7588041\" data-publish_date=\"19-02-2017\" href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/melania-trump-speaks-out-critics-donald-trump-florida-rally-a7588041.html\">Melania Trump speaks out against her critics at Florida rally </a></li> <li><a data-author=\"Empty\" data-nid=\"7586906\" data-publish_date=\"18-02-2017\" href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/indy100/article/donald-trump-least-popular-president-one-month-polls-approval-rating-obama-gallup-7586906\">Donald Trump is the least popular president in modern times</a></li> </ul></div> </div> <p>Yet younger people in Grant County also said they supported Mr Trump.

I’m confident the polls will improve.”</p> <p>That view is not backed up by Mr Corbyn’s personal ratings, which have dropped to a net minus 35 – matching those of Michael Foot at the same stage of his leadership in the early 1980s.</p> <p>One poll last week found support for Labour had dropped by three percentage points to 27 per cent, while backing for the Conservatives rose three points to 40 per cent, as the Brexit Bill passed through the Commons.</p> <p>However, in Stoke, the Ukip leader Paul Nuttall’s campaign is in deep trouble after he admitted he had not – as claimed – lost close personal friends in the Hillsborough tragedy.</p> <p>In Copeland, the Prime Minister was criticised for failing to offer any guarantees about the future of maternity care or nuclear power – two dominant issues in the constituency.</p> <div class=\"relatedlinkslist inline-block-related-list inline-block-left\"> <p class=\"box-title\">Read more</p> <div class=\"relatedlinkslist-content\" style=\"min-height: 10px;\"> <ul class=\"related\"><li><a data-author=\"Rachel Roberts...\" data-nid=\"7576516\" data-publish_date=\"12-02-2017\" href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/mps-david-davis-sexist-texts-leaked-diane-abbott-a7576516.html\">MPs brand David Davis 'disgusting' and 'sexist' following leaked texts</a></li> <li><a data-author=\"Ben Kentish...\" data-nid=\"7563526\" data-publish_date=\"05-02-2017\" href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/diane-abbott-article-50-vote-parliament-brexit-bill-european-union-anna-soubry-bbc-andrew-marr-a7563526.html\">Sick Abbott condemned for not voting – when even cancer patients did</a></li> <li><a data-author=\"Rob Merrick...\" data-nid=\"7548731\" data-publish_date=\"27-01-2017\" href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-oppose-brexit-bill-article-50-legislation-amendments-thrown-out-diane-abbot-shadow-home-a7548731.html\">Labour may oppose Article 50 Bill if amendments rejected</a></li> <li><a data-author=\"Joe Watts...\" data-nid=\"7468091\" data-publish_date=\"11-12-2016\" href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/diane-abbott-poll-gap-12-months-jeremy-corbyn-labour-a7468091.html\">Labour will close poll gap with Tories within a year, Abbott claims</a></li> </ul></div> </div> <p>Meanwhile, Ms Abbott revealed her staff were scared to let her walk around her North London constituency on her own.</p> <p>And she spoke of “almost daily abuse, being called a bitch, a nigger, rape threats, people saying I should be hanged – and it reached a particular pitch in the last few weeks”.</p> <p>“Now you can press a button and threaten to rape somebody and the more some of these guys see this stuff online the more they feel encouraged and emboldened,” Ms Abbott said.</p> <p>“And it’s become turbo-charged and it’s become worse – and it’s almost as if they want to drive some of us out of politics.”</p> </p>"

All of those arguments were aired in the referendum last year.”</p> <p>Presenter Marr pointed out to the Lord Chancellor that Article 50 was, in fact, a legal matter. </p> <p>Ms Truss then replied: “As Lord Chancellor, I do not make legal decisions.

But David Cameron normalised that by appointing two non-lawyers, Chris Grayling and Michael Gove, before her. </p> <p>We’re all sick to the eye teeth with experts, as Gove observed, and Truss’s ignorance of her duty to protect the judiciary from political pressure was a huge advantage when the tabloids attacked the Article 50 judges. After taking days to understand it was her job to defend them, she only did so with robotic churlishness.</p> <p>Not content to rest on that laurel, she turns her mind to penal reform. Last year, prisoner suicides reached a record level and assaults rose by more than 30 per cent. Shameful understaffing and overcrowding are giving rise to rioting of the kind seen in Birmingham in December. The system, she conceded during her mesmerisingly clueless appearance on <em>The Andrew Marr Show</em>, is in chaos. </p> <p>But be not afeared, because Truss has an ingenious solution to the crisis. She wishes our nicks to capture the spirit of her favourite prison movie, <em>The Shawshank Redemption</em>. “It shows prisons can be very difficult places,” she tells <em>The Sun</em>. “But they can also be places of hope where people decide to do things differently.” </p> <p>While this choice of role model is certainly inspiring, she doesn’t specify which aspects of the plot qualify Shawshank as “a place of hope”. Perhaps she’d glance at the following and get back to us on this.</p> <div class=\"dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-video\"><div class=\"dnd-atom-rendered\"><!-- scald=5250041:sdl_editor_representation --><div class='image'><!-- Start of Brightcove Player --> <div class=\"bc_container\"> <video id=\"5328966674001\" data-account=\"624246174001\" data-player=\"2d3d4a83-ba40-464e-9bfb-2804b076bf67\" data-embed=\"default\" data-video-id=\"5328966674001\" class=\"video-js\" controls></video> <script src=\"http://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/2d3d4a83-ba40-464e-9bfb-2804b076bf67_default/index.min.js\"></script> </div> <!-- End of Brightcove Player --> </div><!-- END scald=5250041 --></div><div class=\"dnd-caption-wrapper\">Liz Truss says revoking of Article 50 wouldn't be a legal issue</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>On Andy Dufresne’s first night, a fellow newbie is beaten to death by a guard for crying. Dufresne is regularly gang raped. He launders money for a corrupt governor who rents out inmates as slave labour, and orders the killing of a young prisoner with the evidence to clear Dufresne of the murders for which he was wrongly convicted. </p> <p>If none of the above qualify on the hope front, is she thinking of Brooks, the old lifer who is so completely institutionalised that he hangs himself soon after being paroled? </p> <p>Or does she see the trail to redemption as the one blazed by Morgan Freeman’s Red? Find yourself a mate like Dufresne, in other words, who will spend decades using a tiny rock hammer to tunnel out of the cell; crawl through 300 yards of sewerage to freedom; and leave instructions about how to find him on a Mexican beach underneath a rock in a field on the off chance that one day you’ll be paroled?</p> <p>When it’s put like that, it does look ridiculously simple. On the other hand, how many of Britain’s 85,000 prisoners have the gumption and endurance to replicate Dufresne’s escape?</p> <p>In Truss’s defence, infusing British nicks with that progressive Shawshank spirit isn’t her only brainwave. Apart from recruiting 2,500 more guards (less than half the number who have left since 2010), she wants to implement a “tough but fair” regime, which is nice if vague. </p> <div class=\"inline-block inline-block-related-single inline-block-left\" data-nid=\"/news/uk/politics/prison-officers-are-handed-immediate-pay-rises-of-up-to-5000-in-a-bid-to-reverse-a-dangerous-a7587681.html\"><a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/prison-officers-are-handed-immediate-pay-rises-of-up-to-5000-in-a-bid-to-reverse-a-dangerous-a7587681.html\"><img src=\"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/readmore_card/public/thumbnails/image/2016/12/25/15/prison-skyline.jpg\" /><div class=\"capsules\"> <ul><li> <div class=\"label context-capsule\">Read more</div> </li> </ul></div> <div class=\"content\"> <p>Prison officers handed £5,000 pay rises to reverse staffing crisis</p> </div> </a></div> <p>Best of all, as she recently told a startled Commons, barking dogs could be deployed to prevent drones flying drugs into prisons.

      "body": "<p>Seventy-five years ago, on 19 January 1942, the then President of the United States, Franklin D Roosevelt, signed an executive order. I doubt it was treated as quite the photo opportunity that more recent executive orders have become – this was a few decades before Twitter and Facebook Live – but its effect was nonetheless immediate and devastating. This order, the now notorious Executive Order 9066, would ultimately lead to the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-surrogate-muslim-registry-japanese-internment-camps-precedent-a7422171.html\">internment of over 100,000 Americans with Japanese ancestry</a>, on American soil.</p> <p>There is a narrative in our press at the moment that tends to draw parallels between <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-last-night-in-sweden-terror-attack-melbourne-florida-campaign-rally-a7588021.html\">Donald Trump</a> of the modern United States and Adolf Hitler of 1930s Germany. I see the superficial reasons for which these kind of parallels might be drawn, but I urge you not to fall into the trap of thinking this is “just like fascism all over again”. If you give it a closer analysis, there are some very clear differences between the America of 2017 and Germany of 1939.</p> <p>The question isn’t so much “is this the same as that” but whether recent events in global politics – for instance <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-us-president-white-house-disarray-john-mccain-munich-security-conference-a7586821.html\">Trump</a>’s imposition of the travel ban (which he now refers to openly as a “ban”), a policy directly targeting people of certain ethnic backgrounds – is perhaps symptomatic of an underlying change somehow. Ten years ago, the idea of internment camps based on ethnicity would have felt very alien to me, even impossible.

On this day, 75 years ago, it made sense to the American government of the time to imprison everyone of Japanese ethnicity. Is it so unimaginable that Trump would never consider putting comparable policies in place? </p> <div class=\"inline-block inline-block-related-single inline-block-left\" data-nid=\"/news/world/americas/donald-trump-executive-orders-barack-obama-climate-change-women-police-abortion-muslim-ban-a7573316.html\"><a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-executive-orders-barack-obama-climate-change-women-police-abortion-muslim-ban-a7573316.html\"><img src=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/s3/files/styles/readmore_card/public/thumbnails/image/2017/02/07/15/gettyimages-632489934-0.jpg\" /><div class=\"capsules\"> <ul><li> <div class=\"label context-capsule\">Read more</div> </li> </ul></div> <div class=\"content\"> <p>Trump has signed more executive actions so far than any President</p> </div> </a></div> <p>A much more interesting parallel is that between Trump and Roosevelt, but this is cited far less often, and is far more uncomfortable – Roosevelt is often hailed as an American hero. On the surface, Roosevelt’s America was at war, unlike Trump’s, and many would argue that the circumstances under which he operated and made decisions were radically different; nevertheless, there are many others who would attest that America is at war with Islamic fundamentalism. </p> <p>Mercifully, I am in no way able to predict the future – that would make for a very dull existence. Still, I feel we are moving towards a world much closer to the one we perhaps wrongly assumed would remain confined to dusty textbooks, and the thought of people being herded into internment camps in the 21st century, however remote, is no longer an impossibility. </p> </p>"

      "body": "<p>It looks as if the results of the two <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/corbyn-calls-on-by-election-voters-to-back-labour-and-reject-austerity-a7586616.html\">by-elections</a> on Thursday will be the worst possible for Labour: it will hold both seats. That means <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-labour-turmoil-resign-simon-fletcher-brexit-shadow-cabinet-a7586046.html\">Jeremy Corbyn</a>’s leadership will be prolonged for a bit longer, and the damage to Labour’s image will be more serious. </p> <p>When the dates for the by-elections were set, things looked more hopeful for the Opposition. I carried out a straw poll of Westminster journalists in the middle of last month and 18 out of 31 thought the Conservatives would win in <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-latest-copeland-cumbria-visit-nuclear-power-station-brexit-jeremy-corbyn-hopsitals-a7582661.html\">Copeland</a>, while 22 of the 31 predicted Labour would hold on in Stoke-on-Trent Central against <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ukip-paul-nuttall-claim-controversy-latest-by-election-stoke-hillsborough-charity-a7586966.html\">Ukip</a>. Naturally I was in the minority on both, predicting Labour would hold Copeland and lose Stoke, but I now think Labour will hold them both. </p> <p>Since my survey, several things have happened. First, as expected, Ukip selected its leader, Paul Nuttall, to contest Stoke. Second, Nuttall began to self-destruct within minutes. Sometimes, these games of journalistic <em>gotcha!</em> with by-election candidates don’t have much effect on the voters, but the confusion about whether Nuttall was at the Hillsborough stadium disaster and whether he knew anyone who died there has cut through. </p> <script type='text/javascript'> var gptadslots=[]; var googletag = googletag || {}; googletag.cmd = googletag.cmd || []; </script> <script async='async' src='https://www.googletagservices.com/tag/js/gpt.js'></script> <script type=\"text/javascript\"> googletag.cmd.push(function() { gptadslots[1]= googletag.defineSlot('/71347885/INDY_App/INDY_Voices_Article', [[300,250]],'mpu0').setCollapseEmptyDiv(true).addService(googletag.pubads()); googletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest(); googletag.pubads().enableAsyncRendering(); googletag.enableServices(); }); </script> <div id='mpu0' align='center'> <script type='text/javascript'> googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('mpu0'); }); </script> </div> <p>Third, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-latest-copeland-cumbria-visit-nuclear-power-station-brexit-jeremy-corbyn-hopsitals-a7582661.html\">Theresa May visited Copeland</a>. It is still unusual for a prime minister to campaign in a by-election and it made me think that she must be intending to unveil something like the Humber Bridge – the announcement of which was credited with winning the Hull North by-election for Labour in 1966. On the contrary, she insisted unconvincingly that the Moorside nuclear power station was going ahead despite doubts about its financing, and repeatedly dodged questions about a local NHS maternity unit. </p> <div class=\"dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-video\"><div class=\"dnd-atom-rendered\"><!-- scald=5202421:sdl_editor_representation --><div class='image'><!-- Start of Brightcove Player --> <div class=\"bc_container\"> <video id=\"5301215707001\" data-account=\"624246174001\" data-player=\"2d3d4a83-ba40-464e-9bfb-2804b076bf67\" data-embed=\"default\" data-video-id=\"5301215707001\" class=\"video-js\" controls></video> <script src=\"http://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/2d3d4a83-ba40-464e-9bfb-2804b076bf67_default/index.min.js\"></script> </div> <!-- End of Brightcove Player --> </div><!-- END scald=5202421 --></div><div class=\"dnd-caption-wrapper\">Ukip's Paul <span class=\"scayt-misspell-word\" data-scayt-lang=\"en_GB\" data-scayt-word=\"Nuttall\">Nuttall</span> launches by-election campaign in Stoke</div></div> <p>Nuttall obviously thought he had a chance in Stoke, and May thought the Conservative candidate, Trudy Harrison, had a chance in Copeland. Perhaps the Prime Minister knows something we don’t, but I think those chances were never good. Ukip has struggled in by-elections, except, before the EU referendum, where sitting Tory MPs defected. And the government party hasn’t gained a seat in a by-election, except for a special case where the SDP split the opposition vote in 1982, since 1961. </p> <p>Two other things have happened that might have a bearing on the by-elections. Ten days ago Corbyn led most Labour MPs into the Government lobby to pass the bill to give the Prime Minister the power to start formal talks on leaving the EU. The Labour candidates in Copeland and Stoke both supported remaining in the EU, but are now aligned with their leader’s policy of supporting the start of the Article 50 procedure. That has reduced the scope for the Tories and Ukip to run campaigns, in two seats that voted to leave the EU, as votes for “getting on with Brexit”. </p> <div class=\"inline-block inline-block-related-single inline-block-left\" data-nid=\"/voices/paul-nuttall-ukip-stoke-by-election-hillsborough-close-personal-friend-a7582961.html\"><a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/paul-nuttall-ukip-stoke-by-election-hillsborough-close-personal-friend-a7582961.html\"><img src=\"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/readmore_card/public/thumbnails/image/2017/02/15/09/gettyimages-632895990.jpg\" /><div class=\"capsules\"> <ul><li> <div class=\"label context-capsule\">Read more</div> </li> </ul></div> <div class=\"content\"> <p>It's not Paul Nuttall's fault he made a mistake about Hillsborough</p> </div> </a></div> <p>Then on Friday a Labour former prime minister who shall remain nameless made a speech saying it was his mission to change the minds of the British people about Brexit. Some Labour members who agreed with him nevertheless thought his timing was intended to embarrass the party in the week before the by-elections. Well, every little helps, I suppose, but I still think Labour will hold those seats. </p> <p>Which means that Corbyn will carry on as leader for the time being. In fact, even if Labour loses one or both seats, he wouldn’t go straight away, although it might shorten the fuse. </p> <div class=\"dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-gallery\"><div class=\"dnd-atom-rendered\"><a bah href=\"gallery:4944621\"></a></div></div> <p>And the former prime minister’s speech exposed a problem for Labour that is more fundamental than Corbyn’s leadership. The question of the leadership is twofold: it is not simply a matter of finding someone with better leadership skills than Corbyn, but of deciding what the party’s position on Brexit ought to be, as that is the subject that is going to dominate the next two years. </p> <div class=\"inline-block inline-block-related-single inline-block-left\" data-nid=\"/voices/jeremy-corbyn-labour-paul-nuttall-ukip-stoke-on-trent-central-copeland-by-elections-labour-party-a7581546.html\"><a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/jeremy-corbyn-labour-paul-nuttall-ukip-stoke-on-trent-central-copeland-by-elections-labour-party-a7581546.html\"><img src=\"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/readmore_card/public/thumbnails/image/2017/01/19/15/corbyn-concerned.jpg\" /><div class=\"capsules\"> <ul><li> <div class=\"label context-capsule\">Read more</div> </li> </ul></div> <div class=\"content\"> <p>The crucial by-elections that could signal the end for Jeremy Corbyn</p> </div> </a></div> <p>The paradox of the former prime minister’s speech is that, while it was important and the opposite of undemocratic to have someone make that argument and to make it well, it is not obvious that it is the right argument for the official Opposition to make. Indeed, if a young Tony Blair were a Labour MP now I think he would have voted for the Brexit bill last week, and I think he would now be running for the Labour leadership on a platform of trying to make Brexit softer, rather than one of trying to reverse it. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/could-clive-lewis-be-the-next-labour-leader-the-one-who-starts-the-long-march-back-to-government-a7574911.html\" target=\"_blank\">Clive Lewis</a>, the former shadow Business Secretary who resigned last week, has positioned himself in what looks like the Blairite zone of opposing Brexit. He may be vindicated in the long run, but if a vacancy for the Labour leadership arose now it is not clear that an anti-Brexit candidate would win it. </p> <p>The vote to leave the EU in last year’s referendum has done deep and irreversible things to British politics. Whether Corbyn is the Labour leader for a few months or a few years more, the party is only at the very beginning of coming to terms with that change.</p> </p>"

With this in mind, I’ve started a petition urging the Mayor to use his screening of <em>The Salesman</em> – which is expected to draw a crowd of 10,000 and is backed by the likes of Mike Leigh and Lily Cole – to demand Nazanin’s release. Sadly, though, City Hall has told <em><a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2017/02/16/petition-urges-sadiq-khan-to-demand-iran-free-british-mother-at-oscar-film-screening-6452475/\">Metro</a></em> that this is not its job, it’s the Foreign Office’s.</p> <p>It remains a mystery why a director who is not British and whose film is not about Britain is a more pressing concern to the Mayor than one of his own citizens wrongly jailed in Tehran.</p> <div class=\"dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-gallery\"><div class=\"dnd-atom-rendered\"><a bah href=\"gallery:4262166\"></a></div></div> <p>In fact, why is it London’s responsibility to screen this film at all? Had Asghar Farhadi been banned from the US it would make sense, but Farhadi is boycotting the Oscars because he cannot countenance the “ifs and buts” that might accompany special provisions to ensure his presence in Tinseltown – he is choosing not to go.</p> <p>How is that London’s business? If it’s a matter of championing Muslims, is there a shortage of talented UK Muslims? And why choose the relatively privileged Iranians over Somalis or Sudanese?</p> <div class=\"inline-block inline-block-related-single inline-block-left\" data-nid=\"/voices/selfie-obsession-craze-teenagers-adults-punk-janet-street-porter-a7585866.html\"><a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/selfie-obsession-craze-teenagers-adults-punk-janet-street-porter-a7585866.html\"><img src=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/s3/files/styles/readmore_card/public/thumbnails/image/2017/01/23/11/gettyimages-459508193.jpg\" /><div class=\"capsules\"> <ul><li> <div class=\"label context-capsule\">Read more</div> </li> </ul></div> <div class=\"content\"> <p>Don't worry about the selfie craze – it'll die off soon enough</p> </div> </a></div> <p>Nazanin is sadly a victim of the left’s hypocrisy. If the Mayor was to screen an Israeli film in the name of diversity, charged and angry protests would take place.</p> <p>Iran’s human rights abuse is, like its filmmaking, world class – yet there is no BDS movement to hound Khan’s decision to, let’s face it, roll out the red carpet for the new Saudis, despotic Islamists whose crimes we choose to ignore.</p> <p>If the Mayor will not speak out for Nazanin he must surely, on behalf of Londoners, invite her husband Richard Ratcliffe to speak at the screening. Foreign Office’s job? Do a John Bercow. If he fails to do so, I will be campaigning for Iranians, starting with Farhadi, to disavow this event, to boycott it.</p> <p><em>Click here to sign the <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/london-must-tell-tehran-to-freenazanin-at-mayor-s-screening-of-iran-oscar-film?recruiter=281234446&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=facebook&amp;utm_campaign=share_facebook_responsive&amp;utm_term=des-lg-share_petition-custom_msg\">petition</a></em></p> </p>"
